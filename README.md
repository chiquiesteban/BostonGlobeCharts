#The BostonGlobeCharts templates

This set of templates provides a quick, easy, Globe-styled way, to generate basic charts. They can be used as a final produt or as a nice starting point to create something bigger.

##How to use it

1. Download the zip and you'll have a ready-made GlobeGenerator project
2. You can open the project with Sublime (Open project, look for globegraphic.sublime-project), there will be folders on the left side of the interface to access the different templates.
3. Access it in the Terminal
4. Write `gulp` and enter
5. If it doesn't work, you will probably have to run `sudo npm install`
6. After the gulp, you will see a list of templates. Select the one you want to see and it will open a live server where you'll be able to see your advances.
7. For basic charts, the only files you need to change are js/utils.js (for the data) and html/graphic.html (Headline, subtitle, source...)
8. Once you're ready, stop the server in the Terminal using ctrl+c
9. Gulp again, and select 'yes' when asked if you want to compile a JPT
10. You'll see how a file called PROD.jpt is updated. Its content is the only thing you'll need to upload to Workbench.
